•	/api/currencies?date=<date>

  SELECT CurrencyCode, ValueInUSD
  FROM CurrencyValuations
  WHERE datetime(DateOfValuation) = datetime(<string date>);

  datetime expects a string of YYYY-MM-DD, dummy data is in form DD-MM-YYYY
  as long as we don't touch the time part it will default to 00:00:00
  can look into string reversal functions to allow DateOfValuation to be stored in DD-MM-YYYY

•	/api/companies?date=<date>

  SELECT CompanyName, CompanyID, DateEnteredInSystem
  FROM Companies
  WHERE datetime(DateEnteredInSystem) <= datetime(<string date>);

•	/api/products?date=<date>

  SELECT ProductName, MarketPrice, CompanyCode, ProductID, DateEnteredInSystem
  FROM ProductValuations NATURAL JOIN Products NATURAL JOIN ProductSellers
  WHERE datetime(DateOfValuation) = datetime(<string date>);

•	/api/trades?filter=<filter object>

  - isDryRun (return the number of matches and not the matches themselves)

    replace the first line of any query below with

      SELECT COUNT(*)

  - date range (startData, endDate) (date when created or last modified?)

    SELECT AssetType, Quantity, BuyingParty, SellingParty, NotionalValue, NotionalCurrency, UnderlyingPrice, UnderlyingCurrency, StrikePrice, MaturityDate, TradeID, DateOfTrade
    FROM DerivativeTrades
    WHERE datetime(DateOfTrade) BETWEEN datetime(<string date>) AND datetime(<string date>)
    ORDER BY datetime(DateOfTrade) DESC;

    datetime() might not be needed in orderby, don't know how sqlite deals with string ordering

  - exact tradeID

    SELECT AssetType, Quantity, BuyingParty, SellingParty, NotionalValue, NotionalCurrency, UnderlyingPrice, UnderlyingCurrency, StrikePrice, MaturityDate, TradeID, DateOfTrade
    FROM DerivativeTrades
    WHERE TradeID = ?
    ORDER BY datetime(DateOfTrade) DESC;

  - companies involved

    SELECT AssetType, Quantity, BuyingParty, SellingParty, NotionalValue, NotionalCurrency, UnderlyingPrice, UnderlyingCurrency, StrikePrice, MaturityDate, TradeID, DateOfTrade
    FROM DerivativeTrades
    WHERE BuyingParty = ? OR SellingParty = ?
    ORDER BY datetime(DateOfTrade) DESC;

    could be split into 2 more, just filtering on BuyingParty/SellingParty not both as well as this one

    SELECT AssetType, Quantity, BuyingParty, SellingParty, NotionalValue, NotionalCurrency, UnderlyingPrice, UnderlyingCurrency, StrikePrice, MaturityDate, TradeID, DateOfTrade
    FROM DerivativeTrades
    WHERE BuyingParty = ?
    ORDER BY datetime(DateOfTrade) DESC;

    SELECT AssetType, Quantity, BuyingParty, SellingParty, NotionalValue, NotionalCurrency, UnderlyingPrice, UnderlyingCurrency, StrikePrice, MaturityDate, TradeID, DateOfTrade
    FROM DerivativeTrades
    WHERE SellingParty = ?
    ORDER BY datetime(DateOfTrade) DESC;

  - product name

    trades not linked to product table at all, just asset type field

    SELECT AssetType, Quantity, BuyingParty, SellingParty, NotionalValue, NotionalCurrency, UnderlyingPrice, UnderlyingCurrency, StrikePrice, MaturityDate, TradeID, DateOfTrade
    FROM DerivativeTrades
    WHERE AssetType = ?
    ORDER BY datetime(DateOfTrade) DESC;

  - currency

    SELECT AssetType, Quantity, BuyingParty, SellingParty, NotionalValue, NotionalCurrency, UnderlyingPrice, UnderlyingCurrency, StrikePrice, MaturityDate, TradeID, DateOfTrade
    FROM DerivativeTrades
    WHERE UnderlyingCurrency = ?
    ORDER BY datetime(DateOfTrade) DESC;

  - commodity value (which exact value are we filtering by though)

    unsure what this means

  - userID created by

    log table not linked to trades

POST

•	/api/check_trade

  haven't got database support for this yet

•	/api/trades

  INSERT INTO DerivativeTrades(DateOfTrade, AssetType, BuyingParty, SellingParty, NotionalAmount, Quantity, NotionalCurrency, MaturityDate, UnderlyingPrice, UnderlyingCurrency, StrikePrice, LastUserID, DateLastModified)
  VALUES(?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, datetime('now'));

  this assumes that the tradeID is autogenerated, and so a value can't be supplied
  depends on how schema is defined
  DateLastModified could be generated client side, or by python, or by database

  if id generated by python then

  INSERT INTO DerivativeTrades
  VALUES(?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, datetime('now'));

  IF PRODUCT
    INSERT INTO ProductTrades
    VALUES(?, ?);

    parameter order is ProductID, TradeID

  IF STOCK
    INSERT INTO StockTrades
    VALUES(?, ?);

    parameter order is StockID, TradeID

  INSERT INTO EventLog
  VALUES(?, 'Added', datetime('now'), ?);

  parameter order is EventID, UserAction, DateOfEvent, EmployeeID

PATCH

are these replacing every field? might be faster if it only updates the changed fields?
